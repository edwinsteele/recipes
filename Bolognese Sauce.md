# Amazing Bolognese Sauce (Ragu)

This is a bolognese sauce, aka Ragù alla Bolognesa from Colette Haydon John.

30-45 min prep, 4 hrs cooking time.

## Ingredients

* 125ml olive oil
* 1 large onion, finely diced
* 6 celery stalks, finely diced or grated
* 4 carrots, grated
* 125g thinly sliced pancetta, roughly chopped
* 750g mince, brought to room temperature
* salt
* freshly ground black pepper
* pinch ground nutmeg
* 250ml red wine
* 750ml beef or chicken stock, heated
* 800g Italian peeled tomatoes, chopped with their juice
* handful of fresh oregano leaves

## Steps

0. Preparation
Take the mince out of the fridge so that it's at room temperature when ready to cook.

1. Make your soffrito
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy based pot, then add the diced vegetables and oregano and stir over high heat for 5 minutes until they are soft but not browned.

2. Add the meats
Add the pancetta to the soffrito, allowing it to release some of its fats. Season the chuck steak with salt and pepper, and add. Make sure the meat is at room temperature to allow it to sear and not stew when it hits the pan. Brown the meat, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking. Add the pinch of nutmeg.

3. Add the wine
Add the wine and let it bubble up until it has almost evaporated.

4. Add the stock
Add the heated stock a cup at a time, allowing each cup to evaporate and enrich the sauce before adding the next. This is much like the process of making a risotto and will give you a truly voluptuous sauce. Keep a bit of stock to wash out the tomato cans.

5. Add the tomatoes
Pour in the tomatoes with their juice, bring the whole pot to a boil then reduce to a low simmer and allow to gently bubble, uncovered, for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.

## Serve

The people of Bologna traditionally serve their ragù with homemade fresh egg pasta, usually tagliatelle or pappardelle, but a ribbon or short dried pasta is also perfectly suitable, but never spaghetti which is too thin to hold the chunky sauce.

Cook your pasta in plenty of salted water. If you are using dried pasta, ensure you cook it to ‘al dente’ and no further.

Heat a serving dish. Drain the pasta and turn into the dish. Add the sauce and mix well. Serve with freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan Cheese). Enjoy!
