# The classic charcoal maker's spaghetti, made with eggs and cheese

Many recipes call for cream, but this is not traditional. The creaminess from the eggs and cheese, cooked by the heat of the pasta, is enough. If pancetta is unavailable you can use a good quality, lean bacon. Living in the south I sometimes use country ham pieces. 

Makes 5 portions. 15 min prep, 30 min cooking.

# Ingredients 
* 500g spaghetti
* 50g butter
* 90ml extra-virgin olive oil
* 120g pancetta, cut into thin strips (or 80g short cut bacon)
* 150ml cup dry white wine
* 3 eggs
* 6 Tbs Parmigianno-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated
* 1.5 Tbs finely chopped, flat-leaf parsley
* 1/2 large onion, finely diced
* freshly ground, black pepper

# Directions 

1. Put the butter and olive oil in a skillet, over a medium heat. When the butter is melted add the pancetta and onion. Cook until the onion is translucent and the pancetta is well browned, but not crisp.
2. Add the white wine and continue cooking until it has reduced by about half. Remove from the heat.
3. Bring ~2 litres of water to boil in a large pot (enough to cover the pasta).
4. When the water is boiling add the salt and pasta, stirring until it is submerged.
5. In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the cheese, parsley, and a generous amount of fresh black pepper.
6. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain the pasta and add it to the bowl with the egg and cheese mixture. Toss well, until the pasta is coated with the egg and cheese.
8. Rewarm onion and pancetta mix. Once warm, drain off oil/butter mixture.
9. Add the onion and pancetta to the bowl with pasta and mix. Toss again.
10. If necessary, pop the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds. Don't cook longer, or the pasta will be too dry.
11. Serve immediately.
