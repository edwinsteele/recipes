Serves 4. Prep time: 20 minutes. Cooking time 30 minutes.

# Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 long red chillies, seeded and finely chopped
* 5 long bacon rashers (or a few more if short cut)
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
* 5 potatoes, peeled and diced
* 2 x 420g cans sweet corn kernels, drained
* 1L milk
* 250ml chicken stock
* 125g can creamed corn
* 1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves (dressing only)

# Directions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan. Saut√© onion, chillies and coriander for 4 minutes, or until onion has softened.
2. Stir through bacon and cook for another 4 minutes, until bacon is golden
3. Mix in potatoes, corn kernels and creamed corn.
4. Stir in milk and stock (milk is useful for flushing the remaining corn kernels from their tin). Bring to the boil
4. Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 mins or until potato is tender.
5. Optionally top with chopped coriander.


# Notes

Original recipe called for 3 chillies and 2 x 310g cans of corn kernels. Using fewer chillies so it's not so hot, and larger cans of corn because they're sold in 420g cans.
