# Background

Like a lot of my Tex-mex soups this is delicious as is but made even better with toppings. Garnish with a little shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, a slice of avocado and a handful of crushed tortilla chips to not only add interesting textures but take it over the top and make it a lot more fun to eat. Kids will love picking their own toppings.

The lovely thing about this is that your crock pot can do almost all the work. Your chicken will be fork tender after swimming in that spicy broth for hours making it a cinch to shred and toss back into the pot.

Yield: 6 servings
Prep time: 25 minutes

# Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion, diced
* 1 small green or red capsicum, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* coarse salt and fresh black pepper
* 200g can of diced tomatoes
* 1 long green or red chilli
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 250g boneless chicken breasts (no need to cut up)
* 300g can of corn kernels, drained
* 1 can black beans, undrained (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes (or chilli powder)
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano (preferably Mexican), crushed between fingertips
* 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese or monterey jack, plus more for serving
* 1 cup sour cream, plus more for serving
* tortilla chips, for serving
* sliced avocado, for serving, optional

# Instructions

1. In a medium skillet heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, green chilli, capsicum and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile to your crock-pot add the Tomato,  chicken stock, chicken, corn, black beans (if using), chilli powder, cumin, oregano and 1 teaspoon coarse salt or 1/2 teaspoon fine and about 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix in the cooked onions, peppers and garlic.
3. Cook on high 3 - 4 hour or low 5 - 6. Remove the chicken breasts to a cutting board. 
4. Stir the cheese into the soup. Add the sour cream to a medium bowl and temper it so it doesn't curdle by mixing in a few ladles of the soup broth then mixing it into the soup.
5. Shred the chicken or cut into bite-sized pieces and add back to the pot. Taste and season as needed. Cook 1/2 to 1 more hour on low heat.
6. Serve garnished with more cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and avocado
